# Protein Generator


This repository is intended to capture a set of machine learning tools that would be helpful for people who want to build generative models for protein structures. 

These tools are going to split into model architectures (nn), datasets (different featurizations of PDB files), and losses.

Users of this library will be able to make different training regimens to train generative models that generate 3D protein coordinates. There might be other use cases for the utilities provided but I am optimizing it to make training generative models easy (VAEs, GANs, GMMs, Contrastive Loss models). 

Feel free to open an issue/PR if there's anything you would want added!

## Background

Many different biological molecules have been used for drugs over the years including small molecules and proteins. There are an extensive set of protein drugs that are on already FDA approved, most of which are antibodies. These are often discovered by immunizing animals with target antigens and harvesting their antibodies. These antibodies go through extensive rounds of engineering such as making them more human-like, improving their affinity to the target and improving their biophysical properties for pharmacokinetics and manufacturing purposes. Despite many successes, these efforts often end in failure or with antibodies with liabilities entering the clinic. 

Generative models have been proposed for proteins before, mostly to model the joint probability of a sequence and it's structure or folding capacity. Proteins designed using machine learning have been previously observed to be extremely stable and have high melting temperatures which could correlate to better clinical properties. There have been some early efforts to conditionaly generate proteins based on their function, including a successfully crystallized protein generated by a language model (Madani 2021) but this is still mostly an open problem. This repository is intended to accelerate this line of research.
